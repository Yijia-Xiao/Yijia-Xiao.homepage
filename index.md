My name is **Yijia Xiao**.

I am currently a senior undergraduate from Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University. I have been working as a research assistant at [Tsinghua KEG](http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/) since 2019, advised by [Prof. Jie Tang](https://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/jietang/).


## Research Interests
My research interests include computational biology, natural language processing. I am particularly interested in protein folding and virtual screening in computational biology, as well as their applications in drug discovery.


## Projects

### Protein-LM
Pre-trained super large-scale protein language model with Megatron-LM. Protein-LM achieved excellent results on benchmarks provided by [TAPE](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08230). Our largest model (with 3 billion parameters) far exceeds the baseline of protein folding contact map prediction.

Implementation and model files are available [here](https://github.com/THUDM/ProteinLM).
